# Rubix-cube-solver
This project is real-time Rubik Cube solver Using a webcam program scans each of the cube 6 faces using OpenCV for HSV color segmentation Once scanned it constructs a cube string and passes it to the Kociemba algorithm to find the most efficient solution The program then guides the user move by move, by displaying intuitive arrows on the video feed
